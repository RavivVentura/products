The State of CTV Advertising: New Research with Digiday,https://info.innovid.com/blog/the-state-of-ctv-advertising-new-research-with-digiday,"When the pandemic confined people to their homes, streaming became a main source of information, entertainment, and escape. The freedom to view content on any device at any time became even more of a necessity for consumers and greatly accelerated viewership from linear to connected TV (CTV). This trend, along with many others brought about by the pandemic, will be a lasting one; eMarketer predicts that by the end of 2024, fewer than half of U.S. households will subscribe to linear TV.","Thu, 27 May 2021 16:24:57 GMT"

A Plea to Eliminate Manual Tag Wrapping,https://info.innovid.com/blog/a-plea-to-eliminate-manual-tag-wrapping,"Tag wrapping is a pain for everyone involved. Not only does the process of manually wrapping tags greatly slow down the general ad serving process, but it can also lead to delays in updates for marketers who are working with multiple third-party vendors and even delays in the campaign launch. Consider this a plea to set aside the error-prone process of manually wrapping tags and to embrace the accuracy of automation.","Tue, 18 May 2021 18:07:02 GMT"
OTT Composer Changed the Game for Publishers,https://info.innovid.com/blog/ott-composer-changed-the-game-for-publishers,"Having been focused on advanced video solutions at Innovid for the past few years, I’ve witnessed life before and after Innovid’s OTT Composer, a creative tool that allows brands and publishers to build their own interactive CTV ad experiences. In the “before times”, interactive CTV was still thought of as an emerging capability, and publishers were focusing their time on just making sure ads could go live correctly. Unlike desktop and mobile, CTV devices and apps lacked video player and tag type standardization, so every setup was unique and very, very manual. Fast forward to today: not only is CTV an integral part of any marketing mix — up 60% year over year in impressions — but it’s also seeing some of the most innovative creative developments in the industry.","Thu, 13 May 2021 20:02:33 GMT"

But historically the process of ensuring brand safety has come at the cost of speed, hampered by manual tag wrapping workflows.

As Paolo Provinciali, head of media at AB inBev told Digiday, ""We’re working with the networks and all our media partners to figure out ways we can collaborate together and make attention a guarantee the same way I’m guaranteed in-demo reach.” Provinciali continued, “And then making sure what I’m buying commands a certain level of viewable or attentive impression.”","Mon, 17 May 2021 22:14:28 GMT"
Upfront 2021: Finding Engaged Sports Fans,https://www.tvisioninsights.com/resources/upfront-2021-engage-sports-fans,"Live sports are a standard part of most large brands' advertising campaigns and Upfront planning, as evidenced by the more than 4.4 billion in total advertising dollars spent on Sports in Q4 2020, according to Media Radar. 
As marketers consider the impact of these investments it is important to evaluate both audience size and engagement. While we all know a few sports fanatics who are glued to the TV for every second of their favorite team's big game, we also know that live sports are longer in duration than typical programming, and are often co-viewed by more casual fans. As a result, Sports can sometimes report large audiences, but lower levels of attention. 
TVision's Upfront eBook - Six Things Marketers Need to Know this Upfront Season - helps marketers understand the overall value of their live sports investment by factoring in audience size and attention. 
For example, the NFL routinely delivers large audiences, and while viewers are more attentive than average, they do not pay as much attention as viewers of primetime programming overall. This type of insight helps marketers understand the relative value of engaged audiences.","Thu, 13 May 2021 20:06:58 GMT"

Ratings have long served as the primary currency during the Upfront. But we all know that ratings only tell part of the story. In today’s distracted environment, ratings alone don’t mean people are in the room, paying attention.
In tip number 3 in our Upfront planning ebook - Six Things Advertisers Need to Know this Upfront Season -  we provide marketers with a look into the top shows that deliver both ratings and attention. 
A few shows that deliver both audience size and attention are obvious investment opportunities:

The Bachelor
The Conners
Young Sheldon 
NCIS

Download the eBook to see our full chart of top shows. Some programs will surprise you with their placement in our chart - as a few ratings powerhouses fail to deliver strong attention, despite audience size.  


By layering TVision’s person-level engagement data on top of ratings, advertisers can make the most of their Upfront investment by finding shows that truly deliver on the promise of a large and engaged audience.","Tue, 11 May 2021 21:36:06 GMT"

Simplifying API operations with AI as you scale your API programs,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/apigee-x-simplifies-api-management-with-ai/,"APIs are the backbone of digital transformation. Via APIs, you can securely share data and functionality with developers both inside and outside of your organizational boundaries, letting you build applications faster, seamlessly connect and interact with partners, and drive new business revenue. Because APIs encompass business-critical information, any downtime or performance degradation can lead to significant loss in revenue, customers, and brand value. Therefore, there’s mounting pressure on operations teams to ensure that APIs are always available and performing as expected. If the APIs go down, so too do the services that fuel customer experiences and on which the organization relies for collaboration and business processes.However, as you build and scale your API programs, it becomes practically impossible for API operators to manually monitor and manage all your APIs. To help, we brought the power of industry-leading AI and ML technologies to API operations via Apigee X, a major release of our API management platform. Apigee X seamlessly weaves together Google Cloud’s expertise in AI, security and networking to help you efficiently build and manage APIs at scale. Put your API data into actionApigee applies machine learning to your API metadata and provides you the required tools that simplify various aspects of API operations. A great example of AI for APIs is anomaly detection: AI-powered rules trigger alerts based on a set of predefined conditions that are determined by applying Google’s industry-leading machine learning models to your historical API data.Auto-thresholds adjust the monitoring criteria of your APIs and set them to pattern-based values. Reduce overhead results because operators don’t have to manually monitor anomalies or adjust the monitoring thresholds on APIs.“By applying AI and ML models to our historical API data, these advanced features are able to alert us about scenarios we haven’t thought of. Such automation capabilities significantly reduce our upfront efforts. And from a security perspective, the actionable insights help us ensure that our proxies are exposed only over secure HTTPs ports and adhere to compliance requirements. We’re also able to closely monitor user activity and quickly pull out reports during audits.” - Adam Brancato, Sr. Manager, Global Technology and Security at CitrixAs our customers scale their API programs, they find it extremely useful to harness AI-powered capabilities.  In our recent State of the API Economy 2021 report, we found a 230% increase in enterprises’ use of anomaly detection, bot protection, and security analytics features.To learn more about Apigee X, and see AI and machine learning in action, check out this video, and to try Apigee X for free, click here.Related ArticleThe time for digital excellence is here—Introducing Apigee XApigee X, the new version of Google Cloud’s API management platform, helps enterprises accelerate from digital transformation to digital ...Read Article","Mon, 24 May 2021 16:00:00 -0000"

Why embedding financial services into digital experiences can generate new revenue,https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/financial-services/embedded-finance-and-apis-can-help-modernize-banks/,"Faced with changing customer behaviors and demands, tightening margins, and increasing threat from digital competitors, financial services institutions (FSIs) will need to meet customers where they are, open up their services, and establish new ways to monetize their products. Doing so will also enable them to build a better profile of their customers, and deliver more personalized user experiences and fast, convenient banking and payment services. Cloud technology plays a big role in this shift toward digital FSIs. In Asia, bank branches now account for just 12% to 21% of monthly transactions in the region, with customers turning to digital channels for routine transactions such as peer-to-peer transfers and bill payments, according toMcKinsey&Company. Overall customer engagement has climbed from an average 12.7 to 14.9 transactions a month in Asia's developed markets, and from 6 to 8.1 in emerging markets.1Fueled by growing smartphone adoption, the evolving customer behavior and momentum toward digital platforms have enabled digital-first players to snag a growing piece of the banking pie. McKinsey estimates that digital banking penetration has grown an average of 97% in Asia's developed markets, and 52% in emerging markets, with between 30% and 50% of those that have yet to use digital banking likely to do so.Consumers now are more than ready to make the switch to neobanks, or digital banks. In Singapore, 63% are open to banking with digital-only players, according to aVisa study. On what will entice them to do so, 63% point to bill payments while 56% will use neobank services to make payments at retail outlets. Furthermore, 54% prefer digital banks for the convenience they offer while 52% like the faster service.Among those who are open to digital banks, 60% will move some services from their current bank to these new players even if the latter have no prior banking experience. One in five of respondents say they are willing to switch all services to a neobank.The same is true for small and midsize businesses (SMBs) in Singapore. According to a separatesurvey by Visa, 88% of these companies will consider moving some services to digital banks.Driven to do so by their frustration over a lack of quality corporate products and control of their banking experience, 55% of SMBs believe neobanks will help bring down overall banking costs. Another 54% say digital banks offer greater convenience, while 53% point to greater ease in paying bills online.These stats should worry even established FSIs, especially those that have not done quite enough to open up their service ecosystems and drive innovation through APIs.An API toward new revenueWhile most banks have active APIs, the services that some of them currently provide are just functional; they’re the means to an end for partners to obtain their targeted products and services. Without knowing, consumers use these types of APIs indirectly by using their favorite applications every day—a payment processing API will enable them to purchase their lunch, while a loan application API will get them that dream home.But while banks do not always own the customer journey, they still can find opportunities to sell their products via partners. Many leading banks are leveraging key technologies, such as API management, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics to embed digital banking into consumers' everyday lives, including groceries, travel, entertainment, healthcare, and food delivery. When traditional banks open up their APIs to third parties offering broader services that pull in unique services into their own apps, they then become plugged into the broader customer journey. This helps boost usage of their services and embeds them in the overall customer experience. It also provides aggregated data that will help banks build richer consumer profiles, and deliver more personalized products and services.APIs also create equal opportunities for smaller participants to be involved in the financial services ecosystem, potentially creating micro-segments that previously may not have existed. With insufficient demand within a closed system, to justify the provision of such services, some customers in these micro-segments have previously been left unserved. The APIs, which facilitate collaboration between the different micro-segments so they can be commercially viable, help assuage this problem. Some banks are also opening up APIs to allow access to datasets that enable businesses to trigger automated workflows and enhance their operational efficiencies. Others, such asBank Rakyat Indonesia (Bank BRI) have generated new revenue by leveragingGoogle Cloud's Apigee to manage their API lifecycle and identify new revenue opportunities.Apigee's monetization feature has helped Bank BRI realize $50 million in revenue and enabled the bank to define its pricing based on API calls and automatically bill based on usage.In addition, the Indonesian bank uses the data analysis alongside Google Maps Platform to score its customer base of 75.5 million, and identify those who can be recruited as BRILink agents for underbanked areas. These agents are customers who maintain a minimum balance of $800 USD and score high on reliability.The appointment of branchless agents via the Agent BRILink app has pushed the loan volume from the bank's branchless business to $26 billion in 2018, up from $15 billion the year before.How banks can get started with APIsClearly, there are new revenue opportunities for banks to leverage the data they already have. Here are some tips to help FSIs kickstart their API journey:Align with internal leadership growth initiatives. Leverage executive key performance indicators around growth and cost savings to foster a culture that offers APIs to micro-segmented markets with an eye on cultivating a healthy financial services ecosystem.Productize APIs with a strong value proposition. Starting with an API-first approach, stock the shelves of your API shop with new services and a strong inventory of APIs that will entice third parties (i.e., retailers, telcos, etc.) to start using them. This customer-first, outside-in approach will serve as a strong base to build on and enable the addition of more APIs as adoption grows.Actively nurture a developer community. A properly trained API manager will ensure constant contact with the developer community, and that partners are provided with case studies to help them identify viable use cases for your APIs.Leverage security as a strategic enabler. Security is a key enabler of the API economy, and most API security postures are defensive. By leveraging deep security tooling together with strong identification of developers, banks can better track information and data usage offensively. FSIs also need to avoid some common pitfalls, such as overlooking the need to continuously improve their APIs. If no one is using it, the API clearly is failing to provide any real value to third-party developers.In addition, efforts should be made to market the APIs and let developers know what is available. A common mistake FSIs make is assuming their work is done once their APIs are released and neglecting the need to carry out community outreach and marketing to generate awareness about the APIs.If you are interested in learning more about this topic, don’t miss our session at the Google Cloud Financial Services Summit on Embedded Finance: The Future of Banking.1.

How DueDil leverages Apigee API-first approach to deliver data insights at scale,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/apigee/google-cloud-helps-duedil-to-deliver-data-insights-at-scale/,"As their name reflects, DueDil provides due diligence services ranging from customer-specific risk evaluations and selections to customer onboarding and real-time risk monitoring for leading financial services, high-growth tech and insurance companies. Founded in 2009, the company helps more than 3,000 enterprise users from over 400 clients to not only understand with whom they’re doing business, but to do so with increased efficiency and in compliance with regulatory requirements. Due diligence services have evolved in recent years, both because of new regulations and new technologies supplanting legacy systems and processes, many of which relied until recently on pen-and-paper workflows or exhaustive spreadsheet work. DueDil knew this technology transformation represented an opportunity to replace manual processes with automation--but it also recognized a second opportunity: to not merely process data but also activate it by connecting information in disparate IT systems and generating data-driven insights delivered at scale.  To capitalize on this opportunity, the company built its Business Information Graph, or B.I.G., a platform that maps approximately 300 million connections among companies. B.I.G. ingests billions of data points, and is refreshed multiple times per day, to surface unique insights about business’s relationships, such as fraud risks. The results that B.I.G. drives often speak for themselves: some DueDil customers onboard partners up to 80% faster, perform risk verification up to 18 times faster, and reduce time spent on manual portfolio checks by up to 80%. What powers all of this transformation? Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). “From a go-to-market standpoint, our product is an API,” said Denis Dorval, DueDil COO, in a recent webcast, explaining that customers can directly tap B.I.G.’s resources for themselves, and build atop them for their own needs, via DueDil’s API. Choosing an API management platform to deliver fast, secure, and scalable APIsTo execute on their vision of connecting B2B ecosystems for better insights and efficiency, DueDil looked for a cloud provider that could fulfill several specific criteria. They needed robust management for the APIs with which their internal developers leverage different systems for new use cases and process automations, as well as for the productized API they offer to customers. They needed sophisticated analytics and abundant processing power to crunch through billions of data points. And, they needed enterprise-grade security, scalability, and agility to underpin it all. Last but not least, the company prioritized a smooth transition; DueDil did not want the user experience to suffer as it switched providers.“The stability of Google Cloud’s Apigee API management platform and the strength of its services stood out”, said DueDil’s Engineering Manager, Robert Cicero. “Apigee is a resilient and agile platform, fulfilling our need to build APIs quickly, safely, and at scale,” he remarked, noting that he appreciated that many of Apigee’s API security defense tools and policies work out-of-the-box. For instance, Apigee’s JSON threat detection policies, custom policies, and authentication and authorization processes can be deployed instantly and add minimal latency, meaning DueDil can stop security threats before they enter its network while still avoiding the risk of service lags.Today, DueDil has five internal services that facilitate business due diligence, all exposed via Apigee. They also use Apigee’s monetization feature to drive API consumption. This said, because DueDil’s go-to-market strategy is fast-paced and client-oriented, they most often use Apigee to rapidly prototype APIs for their clients, so they can understand what a specific API would look like and how it would behave. This allows DueDil, its partners, and its customers to spend more time delivering value from insights rather than getting bogged down in building backend systems. Moreover, Apigee made it simpler to also connect to other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery, Google Data Studio, and Google Cloud Storage. Apigee acts as a central nervous system among systems, giving DueDil not only the ability to connect systems and automate processes but also insight and visibility into how its B.I.G. services are being used by partners and customers. Plus, added Cicero, “the migration to Apigee was seamless, with arguably our biggest win being that no one knew that we had switched API management providers to Apigee.”  Leveraging APIs to provide self-service while enforcing security and governance policiesMoving forward, DueDil plans to leverage Apigee to give staff members and clients more privileges, visibility, and opportunity to create and edit apps in a self-service manner, without needing to rely on an IT department or endure long approvals processes. Harnessing APIs to open up B.I.G. and other capabilities to more teams across the company will also allow DueDil to move faster and include more people in the innovation process. Leveraging Apigee API management capabilities, DueDil also intends to dive deeper and experiment with other Google Cloud products and services, including Cloud Function, Cloud Pub/Sub, and more.“At the end of the day, every company goes about due diligence a little differently. The only way that we at DueDil are able to provide something that is configurable and dynamic to diverse businesses is if we use platforms that can adapt, too,” said Cicero. “Apigee gives us the agility required to create and deliver for a wide variety of businesses.”Google Cloud, today, works across banking, capitalmarkets, insurance, and payments worldwide to solve their most challenging problems.

Seven-Eleven Japan uses Google Cloud to serve up real-time data for fast business decisions,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-7-eleven-japan-built-its-new-data-platform/,"With the rise of technologies like smartphones, retailers have felt the pressure to meet evolving consumer needs and expectations. Seven-Eleven Japan(“SEJ”) has long been on the forefront of this thanks to the way they develop and invest in IT. However, in recent years, Japan’s leading convenience store chain has struggled to maintain its complex legacy systems at the rate needed to keep up with today’s rapid digitization, spurred on by the increasing proliferation of smartphones and an IT vendor-dependent structure.  Legacy systems limiting real-time responsiveness and innovation Since its early days, SEJ has been proactive in adopting information technology, mainly relying on technology solutions from Japan’s leading vendors. But as the systems have grown, key business issues have been resolved using a vendor-dependent structure rather than being driven by SEJ's own needs.  Datasets and business logic were combined and built into legacy environments, gradually leading to data silos. As a result, data was distributed across multiple systems, causing a variety of problems, including the inability to efficiently retrieve data when needed, delays in accessing data collected in individual stores, and difficulties taking measurements at the right time in business operations that require real-time responsiveness.Connecting different systems also takes time and money, and the lead time for introducing new services—from planning to development and launch—has been longer than expected. To solve these problems, SEJ's IT department built “Seven Central”—a new platform for practical data use launched in 2020 to support the company’s future IT strategies and digital transformation initiatives.At its core, Seven Central’s ultimate purpose is to allow real-time data views. Versatile, real-time datasets—such as point-of-sale (POS) data from 7-Eleven stores—are consolidated into a centralized location in the cloud. They created a simple data mart that provides data via an API to enable them to respond more quickly to requests from individual departments. ""In such uncertain times, it’s vital to use data to make quick decisions,"" says Izuru Nishimura, Executive Officer and Head of ICT Department. ""Each department across the entire company will be able to gain an immediate understanding of the situation based on the most up-to-date data and respond accordingly. This is why we built Seven Central.""Google Cloud selected to help SEJ build and grow their data cloudToday's rapidly changing business environment has also highlighted the risk of IT support becoming a bottleneck. The long-term strategy is to gradually expand the datasets managed and collected in Seven Central according to business needs. In the first phase, SEJ collected POS data from all 21,000+ stores to enable real-time analysis. Moving forward, they would like to collect other relevant data—for example, unstructured data, such as images and videos, or master datasets that are currently stored externally. Google Cloud was already a top contender when SEJ started developing Seven Central in 2019. They compared various public cloud services besides Google Cloud, focusing on three main capabilities.""We placed particular emphasis on service scalability to drive future digital transformation; security when handling data, which is the lifeline of our company; and finally, openness,” says Nishimura. He emphasizes that openness was perhaps the most important factor for choosing Google Cloud. Breaking away from the negative aspects of an entirely vendor-dependent system enabled them to build an agile development system with multiple vendors. Google Cloud technologies including BigQuery and API management platform, Apigee, play a vital role in Seven Central. BigQuery’s high-speed processing at petabyte scale and fully managed infrastructure helped keep costs low during development and verification.   ""Data is stored in a way that allows you to share it easily across organizations, which helps solve the issue of data silos from the perspective of scalability. I also like the fact there are some interesting features that could be used in the future—like BigQuery ML, which enables machine learning on BigQuery,"" says Nishimura. Apigee allows SEJ to separate datasets and business logic, which is one of the key points of Seven Central. While the trend these days is to standardize interfaces using an API, the reality tends to involve many different APIs rather than the introduction of one unified API. With Apigee, SEJ provides a single unified API for all of its data cloud, and they can now understand what data is used thanks to Apigee’s API usage visualizations.  ""Right now, we collect data from all 21,000+ stores,"" says Nishimura. “But in anticipation of a future expansion in business operations, we have designed a system that can scale up and run without issue, even if we were to have 30,000 stores, with 1,000 customers per store per day, purchasing five items per person.""Real-time insights with BigQuery and Cloud SpannerGoogle Cloud partner Cloud Ace came on board early in the planning phases. Based on their recommendations, SEJ decided to continue making full use of BigQuery to analyze data collected from all 21,000+ stores throughout Japan, while also using Cloud Spanner’s availability, near-unlimited scalability and transactional consistency to help achieve the real-time results needed for the project.""Given that both the data and the regularity with which it is accessed are expected to steadily increase in the future, we chose Cloud Spanner as backend storage for data delivery via API. We consider it a good choice,"" says Shota Kikuchi, General Manager, Consulting Department, Technology Division, Cloud Ace Co., Ltd.Finally, they chose to use Google Cloud's Stream Analytics Solutions messaging service for collecting POS data in real time, which can then be put to immediate use with Cloud Spanner and BigQuery. High-speed responses exceed targets and create new value Seven Central went live in September 2020 with surprising results. They initially set a target time of one hour from when a customer makes a purchase to the point when Seven Central can use that data. But when the final system was first tried—it took barely a minute. Moving forward they estimate that the latest inventory data from the service side will become available within a few minutes of being added to the system.  ""This is real innovation, and I must admit that I am quite surprised. As well as being able to solve existing issues, we also hope it will lead to new improvements and services that have been unimaginable up until now,"" says Nishimura.The team hopes to roll out the Seven Central platform in all companies affiliated with Seven & i Holdings—not just SEJ. They also plan to explore Google Cloud AI and machine learning technologies to take on challenges in new areas. For example, they are investigating the idea of clustering individual stores using BigQuery ML.Seven Central has already attracted attention from many departments and received a lot of requests. Nishimura and his team say they hope to continue to grow Seven Central while still observing their fundamental principles—not including business logic, maintaining real-time results, and staying true to the uniqueness of SEJ.Learn more about Google Cloud smart analytics solutions.Related ArticleData champions: How the Golden State Warriors are turning on-court data into a competitive advantageLearn how the Warriors are using intelligent technologies with Google’s Data Cloud to better serve the needs of coaches, front office, st...Read Article","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:00:00 -0000"
Better protect your web apps and APIs against threats and fraud with Google Cloud,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/better-app-security-with-google-clouds-waap/,"With web applications and public APIs becoming increasingly important to how organizations interface with their customers and partners, many are turning to dedicated tools that can help protect these assets. As research firm Gartner notes in its 2020 report “Defining Cloud Web Application and API Protection Services,” “By 2023, more than 30% of public-facing web applications will be protected by cloud web application and API protection (WAAP) services that combine DDoS protection, bot mitigation, API protection and web application firewalls (WAFs). This is an increase from fewer than 10% today.”1 Currently, most of these services come in the form of different point solutions for different types of threats. This leads to gaps in protection and increased acquisition and operational costs. To tackle these challenges, Google Cloud has launched a security solution, Web App and API Protection (WAAP), which provides comprehensive threat protection for your web applications and APIs. Google Cloud WAAP is based on the same technology Google uses to protect its public-facing services against web application exploits, DDoS attacks, fraudulent bot activity, and API targeted threats. It represents a shift from siloed to unified application protection, and can deliver improved threat prevention, greater operational efficiencies, and consolidated visibility and telemetry. It also provides protection across clouds and on-premises environments.Google Cloud WAAP combines three leading products to provide comprehensive protection against threats and fraud: Google Cloud Armor, which is part of Google Cloud's global load balancing infrastructure, provides WAF and anti-DDoS capabilities, protecting applications against the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, sophisticated application exploits, and both volumetric and layer 7 availability attacks. Apigee, Google Cloud’s API management platform, provides API lifecycle management capabilities, with a heavy focus on security. The solution verifies API keys, generates and validates OAuth access tokens, rate limits traffic, enforces quotas, and provides analytics on API trends. reCAPTCHA Enterprise provides transparent protection from fraudulent activity, spam, and abuse like scraping, credential stuffing, automated account creation, and exploits from automated bots.Google Cloud WAAP solution high-level architecture“I’ve seen our customers benefit greatly from each part of Google Cloud WAAP, and now that it’s a packaged solution,  we can bring a more comprehensive security solution to a broader set of clients much faster.” said Miles Ward, CTO of SADA Systems. “SADA is excited to partner with Google to bring this outstanding security solution to our customers’ mission critical projects.”How WAAP is helping customers today The following two scenarios showcase how a bank and an airline are using Google Cloud’s WAAP solution to address their heightened security needs. Balancing security requirements with ease of useA bank is launching a new microservices based payment app and, due to the architecture of the application, it exposes several APIs which need to be protected. Three different teams are involved and have different priorities that need to be balanced.Google Cloud’s WAAP solution allows different teams at the bank to collaborate closely to fulfil their requirements using one solution and one vendor. Managing OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security RisksAn airline needs to protect its reservation website from OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. Preventing attackers from utilizing leaked or stolen email addresses and passwords to gain unauthorized access (credential stuffing) is a priority. Their APIs are used by 3rd party travel sites for making reservations, therefore the airline also needs to be able to manage authentication and authorization of their public APIs.The airline uses the Google Cloud WAAP solution, implementing Cloud Armor as a WAF, Apigee as the API management layer, and reCAPTCHA Enterprise to defend against credential stuffing.Google Cloud WAAP solution workflowLet’s take a look at the workflow of this request with the Google Cloud WAAP solution.The first point of contact on the WAAP solution is Cloud Armor. Cloud Armor protects against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi) etc and also provides protection against L3, L4, and L7 DDoS attacks. If none of the above rules are triggered on the Cloud Armor policies, a request is sent to the reCAPTCHA Enterprise API to evaluate whether the incoming traffic is a legitimate request or not [Machine bot vs. Human]. If it is a legitimate request, then the request is forwarded to the airline’s backend. If the request is not a legitimate one, then Cloud Armor has the ability to deny the request by sending a 403 response code to the user. Further, Cloud Armor can take more intelligent actions like redirecting to a different page or forwarding the request to a honeypot. For any API requests, once the Cloud Armor OWASP rules and DDoS protection has been evaluated, the request is then forwarded to Apigee to check the validity of the API request. Apigee is now able to determine if the API keys or access tokens used in the request are valid and that the consumer has access to the API or not. If Apigee determines the request to be a non-legitimate one, Apigee can serve a 403 response code to the end user otherwise, Apigee will forward the request to the Airline’s backend.For all requests being made to the airline’s reservation website, the WAAP solution is the first point of contact and can detect and mitigate bad actors at the edge before the request even reaches the airline’s backend.As more and more organizations accelerate their digital transformation journey, and as business processes and commerce rely more on digital interactions, the need for heightened levels of security and protection has risen significantly. Moving to a unified application protection like Google Cloud’s WAAP solution can help organizations deliver improved threat prevention, greater operational efficiencies, and consolidated visibility and telemetry, in record time.  Get started using WAAP today For more details on how Google Cloud can help with comprehensive web app and API protection, check out our WAAP solution page, watch our on-demand webinar on App Modernization and Protection, and read our whitepaper written by Enterprise Strategy Group on Meeting the challenges of securing modern web applications with WAAP.1.

GraphQL: Building a consistent approach for the API consumer,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/interacting-with-apis-rest-and-graphql/,"Developers use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to assemble data and functionality for new mobile or web apps, but when it comes to interacting with APIs, developers are often faced with two popular options: REST or GraphQL. In this article, we’ll explore how these approaches compare, and we’ll offer REST API best practices that can be applied to build a more consistent experience for GraphQL API consumers. One option is not better than the other, and both can be used within the same teams if not the same projects--but regardless of what kind of APIs a project entails, a more consistent experience will help developers do more, faster.  REST and GraphQL comparedREST is a software architectural style to which APIs conform so developers can interact with services in a standard way. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries. REST and GraphQL are similar in that they identify resources as URLs through which the app can fetch data or functionality—but there are many differences:GraphQL exchanges data at a single endpoint whereas REST often involves several endpoints. GraphQL resolvers retrieve the data for fields, and if one resolver fails, the rest of the query can still retrieve and return useful data. This interaction paradigm mirrors what’s expected from doing multiple REST queries, and as such, one GraphQL query frequently replaces multiple REST queries.GraphQL prevents over-fetching and under-fetching of data—that is, an endpoint responding to a call with too much or too little information, respectively, compared to what the app needs. REST APIs are offered in various levels of resolution. Some retrieve more data, and some retrieve less data. This means an app might receive too much data, such as the whole employee profile when all that was needed was the employee name and ID number. Likewise, it might receive too little data, forcing the app to make several API calls instead of just one.REST uses HTTP verbs, and generally uses JSON in order to exchange payload data, but in GraphQL, the HTTP POST verb is most frequently used, and the different query types are specified inside the protocol. GraphQL also uses a custom query format called Schema Definition Language (SDL), and even though that custom query language is used for the request, JSON is returned, which makes it easier for clients to leverage the response. GraphQL client libraries feature native integration with the ReactJS UI framework, and are also available for other other languages and paradigms, making them accessible to many developers today. The developer’s discovery perspective differs. To understand how REST APIs work, the developer typically uses a portal as the storefront to discover and interact with the APIs. In GraphQL, the portal is a built-in playground that also accommodates development. It's almost like an integrated development environment, allowing developers to explore new queries on the fly, assisted by features like tab completion. Documentation is also different. REST usually uses OpenAPI specs and portals. Some extensions to OpenAPI exist. For example, Apigee SmartDocs builds interactive documentation from those OpenAPI specifications. GraphQL developers typically use schema-based interactive documentation, such as Graphiql to develop and interact with GraphQL endpoints. These qualities make GraphQL popular for an increasing number of use cases but can point to possible adoption challenges. For projects involving interoperability and decomposition of internal infrastructure, GraphQL is a useful tool for creating a few APIs for many disparate legacy systems. But it can also be leveraged in self-service developer programs and related growth strategies, which typically involve enterprises encouraging internal and external innovation by making REST APIs available via an API management platform. These programs differ from traditional infrastructure-centric API projects in that the APIs may be used by many people outside the team that built it, for many uses that team never imagined. This reiterates the importance of a consistent, reliable, intuitive developer experience--and it also raises one of the obstacles to adapting GraphQL: it is relatively easy to glance at a group of REST APIs and intuit what they do and how they work, but we’re not yet as close to that with GraphQL. Using REST-based practices in GraphQLYou should be open to using the best tools for the job, which may include both GraphQL and REST. To work more productively with GraphQL, we recommend adopting some of the REST-based best practices we’ve developed over years of experience building developer programs.Think of APIs as digital products that let enterprises take their assets and, in order to increase the leverage of those assets, put them in the hands of developers, whether those developers are internal employees, partners, or external customers. Because APIs are digital products, developers need a consistent experience in order to understand how to use them, and to bring compelling experiences to market. Developer friction is a huge challenge in adoption of APIs and in growth strategies of digital companies, so just as with REST, consistency is key for GraphQL.Treat the graph as a data-driven hierarchy defined by plural nounsOne of the key tenets of the REST architectural style is to create a simplified, consistent interface that rationalizes infrastructure complexity.  One would never expect a well-formed REST query to be GET/listEmployeesByDepartment––that looks more like a Java function. Rather, a well-formed REST resource would use plural nouns: GET /Employees, then POST /Employees, etc. By reliably conforming to predictable expectations, REST APIs directly affect the speed at which developers are able to consume resources and build new experiences––and time is money.  GraphQL’s schema uses a graph hierarchy to define relationships between entities, such as the titles and authors of books in a catalog. This is a fundamentally data-driven hierarchy but we sometimes see it treated as a functional hierarchy that looks like a Java function––and this can introduce friction by disrupting predictable, intuitive, consistent experiences. A well-formed GraphQL should look like a well-formed REST. If you can GET from /Books, it should be assumed you can POST to /Books. Compare that to a more Java-like construction, defined by a verb-based function instead of a data-based noun, such as GET listBooksByGenre. How can you POST? To /BooksByGenre? To /Books? To /listBooks? Who knows. Our advice is to be data-driven, and to treat the graph as a data-driven hierarchy. Don’t force GraphQL when REST makes more senseIn REST, users often request and submit data from different URLs, especially when using patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), a design pattern first identified by Martin Fowler that separates the model that reads the data from the model that updates the data. Developers often use CQRS in REST to retrieve data from multiple services in microservices architectures. In GraphQL, mutations (the way a GraphQL developer submits data) can get very complex very quickly, especially when there are a lot of different data types or when very little data is submitted. We recommend using a style similar to CQRS that separates retrieving data from submitting data. This may be particularly useful to large enterprises, especially those that already have a REST-based API layer. GraphQL can retrieve data on top of or instead of the API management layer, but data can still be submitted through the existing REST APIs. This demonstrates a developer should not want to force GraphQL when REST makes sense.Optimize for re-usability Large enterprise GraphQL deployments often encounter challenges when many different types of backends need to be made available to developers. Different business units develop different aspects of the schema, which is then presented to developers as one comprehensive graph, frequently through schema stitching of schema federation. The challenges arise when the behavior of the queries returns different data or behaviors from different parts of the graph, because there’s no consistency in the representation of the data. Variable names that look the same in the SDL should not return different values or formats just because they resolve to different data sources.Further, Relay cursor connections and input hints should all present uniform behavior regardless of the portion of the graph being requested. This is particularly a problem with mutations, because if a developer submits data to one part of the schema one way, and it gets recorded one way, they may not realize that when they submitted it in another part of the schema, it was recorded another way. Since mutations are a particular challenge when optimizing for re-usability and API productization, we recommend being particularly conscientious of the way you develop and design them in GraphQL.Lastly, let’s look at field names. It is developer-hostile to have field names with the same name provide different data and behavior because they are in different parts of the schema. For example, when there is a name field in one part of the schema that expects first, middle, last name, and a name field in another part of the schema that expects last name.first name, this incongruence can lead to developer abandonment.In GraphQL, it's easy to optimize for query efficiency, but be intentional about optimizing for re-usability. Avoiding situations in which APIs confuse developers will pay dividends.Whether REST or GraphQL, API is a product that needs to be managedMost of these best practices, from treating the graph as a data-driven hierarchy to optimizing for re-usability and developer consumption, reinforce a central idea: APIs that are useful for growth strategies are products for developers, so the developer’s experience using the API is among the most important determinants of whether the API is adopted or not. With the help of Apigee API Management, developer programs have been embracing this idea for years with REST APIs, and as enterprises apply it more broadly to GraphQL, those API programs will only become more adept at empowering developers to innovate. To learn more about GraphQL vs. REST, check out our video from Google Cloud Next.

Delivering high-performing global APIs with Apigee X and Cloud CDN,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/api-performance-and-availability-with-apigee-x-and-cloud-cdn/,"Organizations are increasingly investing in digital businesses ecosystem strategies to foster innovation and operate efficiently. These ecosystems connect various stakeholders--such as partners, developers, and customers--via application programming interfaces, or APIs. APIs allow various software systems to interface, and are thus the primary mechanism of value exchange within these ecosystems.     For example, Bank BRI, one of the largest banks in Indonesia, drove over $50 million in new revenue by creating an online marketplace with more than 50 monetized open APIs that let over 70 ecosystem partners leverage the bank’s credit scoring, business assessment, and risk management capabilities. Similarly, AccuWeather, the world’s leading weather media and big data company, makes APIs available to more than 70,000 registered developers who’ve used the company’s data and functionality  to create over 30,000 apps.Scaling up digital business ecosystems can unlock new markets, grow regional partnerships, and connect distributed workforces--but all of this starts with scaling up the API program. To help customers globally scale API programs, we are pleased to bring the power of Google’s networking capabilities to API management.  Expand global reach and deliver high performance with Apigee and Cloud CDNApigee X, the latest release of Google Cloud’s full lifecycle API management platform, makes it simple and easy to apply Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) to APIs. Working in tandem, the two solutions let enterprises not only secure and manage their APIs but also make them available across a global ecosystem of stakeholders. Specifically, Apigee lets enterprises apply security to APIs, control how and by whom they’re used, publish them for consumption, monitor and analyze their usage, monetize them, and perform other aspects of API product management. Cloud CDN helps these APIs and the services they support to be performant, regardless of how many ecosystem participants are calling the API or where those ecosystem participants are located. Cloud CDN runs on Google Cloud’s globally-distributed edge network and lets organizations serve content globally. This reduces latency both by leveraging Google’s massive network infrastructure, which supports services such as Gmail and Google Search, and by caching content closer to the users, improving performance and availability for peak traffic seasons. Because digital assets can be served from Google's global edge instead of an organization’s backend systems, web pages and apps can run even faster and offer a smoother experience. By caching often-accessed data at the network edge, as close to the customers and end users, as quickly as possible, Cloud CDN also helps organizations seamlessly handle seasonal spikes in traffic, such as those that may occur during the holiday or back-to-school seasons. In addition to improving ecosystem experiences and reliability, this approach to caching can also minimize web server load, compute usage, and ultimately costs.Better digital experiences lead to bigger digital ecosystemsWhether it’s interacting with customers, partners, or third-party developers, an enterprise’s ability to expand its digital ecosystem is limited by the quality of the digital experiences it creates. If apps load too slowly or services are not consistently available, ecosystem participants will leave. If APIs and the apps they power are not secure, participants will leave. Each link in the digital ecosystem value chain relies on API management and network management to keep interactions flowing--and with the combined power of Apigee X and Cloud CDN, we’re pleased to help our customers meet these challenges and expand their businesses.

Multi-layer API security with Apigee and Google Cloud Armor,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/api-security-with-apigee-and-google-cloud-armor/,"Information security has become headline news on a daily basis. You have probably heard of security risks ranging from malicious bots used in schemes both big and small, to all-out ""software supply chain attacks"" that involve large-name enterprises and their customers, and that ultimately affect numerous governments, organizations, and people. As businesses expand their digital programs to serve their customers via online channels and to operate from anywhere with a global remote workforce, such security attacks are expected to become more common. Because application programming interfaces (APIs) are fundamental components of an enterprises’ digital programs, connecting the data and functionality that power various apps and services, they are also vectors of malicious attacks--as well as sources of insights that enterprises can use to better understand attack patterns and how to thwart them. Our State of the API Economy 2021report found a 172% rise in abusive traffic and a 230% increase in enterprises’ use of anomaly detection, bot protection, and security analytics features. As agile, smart, and proactive digital security mechanisms have become the cost of doing business, API security has become an indispensable part of an enterprise’s IT security portfolio--and as this article explores, our recent release of Apigee X makes API security even more powerful. Multi-layer API security with Apigee and Google Cloud ArmorAPIs are the doors to various digital assets--and every door needs a lock to keep what’s behind it safe and protected from unauthorized access. Therefore, to help organizations secure APIs to the highest level, Google Cloud has brought together Apigee and Cloud Armor, combining industry-leading API management and web application firewall technologies. With Apigee X, the latest release of Google Cloud’s full lifecycle API management platform, customers can easily and seamlessly apply Cloud Armor web application firewall (WAF) to APIs, adding another layer of security to ensure that corporate digital assets are accessed only by authorized users. For companies such as AccuWeather, a global leader in weather data and forecasting, APIs have been essential to both building new applications and monetizing data and functionality for outside developers, so those communities can innovate with AccuWeather assets as well. With this new expanded surface area from their APIs, AccuWeather needed robust security to manage and secure its digital assets.“Over the last decade, AccuWeather has continued to transform as a digital solution for serving business customers with the most accurate and useful weather information using APIs. With Apigee’s strategic partnership and comprehensive API management platform, we were able to design, develop, and launch our industry-leading APIs in a few short weeks.” said Chris Patti, Chief Technology Officer at AccuWeather. “Today, we serve over 50 billion API calls per day. As many organizations embrace their own digital solutions, they are increasingly adopting API-first strategies for accelerated transformation. With the new Apigee X release, we can foresee furthering our API programs with the best of Google capabilities like reCaptcha, Cloud Armor, and Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global scale, performance and security.” Apigee and Cloud Armor together help secure your APIs at multiple levels.Click to enlargeWhile Apigee X includes OAuth (Open Authorization), API keys, role-based access and many other API-level security features, Cloud Armor offers network and application  security such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection, geo-fencing, mitigation of OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 risks, and custom Layer-7 filtering. With Apigee X and Cloud Armor, developers enjoy integrated, out-of-the-box security capabilities to protect their APIs at multiple levels.Click to enlargeCustomers can also easily leverage Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authenticating and authorizing access to the Apigee platform as well as to gain more control over encrypted data with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). Apigee X and Cloud Armor deliver powerful protection for applications and APIs against threats and fraud.  These products are also available as part of our WebApp and API Protection (WAAP) solution that adds anti-bot and anti-abuse measures from reCAPTCHA Enterprise.Security is a moving target, with attackers and new vulnerabilities emerging all the time--but with a multi-layer approach to API security, enterprises can trust that they can quickly leverage APIs for new digital services and experiences without compromising security along the way.  To learn more about Apigee X, and see Apigee and Cloud Armor in action, check out this videoRelated ArticleHow leading enterprises use API analytics to make effective decisionsExplore why API monitoring and analytics are essential to successful digital transformation initiativesRead Article","Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:00:00 -0000"
Google’s Cloud Healthcare Consent Management API now generally available,https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/google-cloud-healthcare-consent-management-api-generally-available/,"Last fall, weannounced the Public Previewof the Google Cloud Healthcare Consent Management API, which gives healthcare application developers and clinical researchers a simple way to manage individuals’ consent over use of health data. Since then, early adopters have used the API to do things like create personalized patient portals, securely integrate data into clinical workflows based on patient consent, and develop virtual clinical trials.     Today, we’re pleased to announce that the Healthcare Consent Management API is generally available, giving customers the ability to greatly scale the management of consents to meet increasing need, particularly amidst the emerging task of managing health data for new care and research scenarios. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare organizations have quickly embraced concepts like virtual care and remote trials. As a result, healthcare application developers and researchers have needed easy and secure ways to manage patient consent. Further, the explosion of rich data generated by devices such as glucose monitors, wearables, and other sources have emphasized the importance of patient consent and privacy, as patients and caregivers look to safely incorporate data from more sources into their care plans.The Healthcare Consent Management API helps by making it easier to satisfy the requirements of existing and emerging privacy and consent frameworks, while supporting the transparent and responsible incorporation of digital health data into patient care and research. The flow of consent and privacy information can work as follows:Administrators within a provider or research organization configure a unique instance of the Healthcare Consent Management API with the privacy concepts and terminology that their organizations use.When a provider or researcher application offers privacy options to a user, the application creates or revises a corresponding consent record within the Healthcare Consent Management API to reflect that user's selected option.As provider or researcher applications write data to their datastores, those applications inform the organization’s Healthcare Consent Management API instance about the relevant privacy characteristics of that data.When providers, researchers or their applications need to determine whether data can be accessed for a particular purpose, a query is sent to the Healthcare Consent Management API, which quickly determines if there is a valid consent record permitting that access. The Healthcare Consent Management API adds to Google Cloud’s efforts to bring innovative technologies to the healthcare and life sciences industries—particularly in data security, privacy, and interoperability. For example, our Healthcare API facilitates construction of cloud-native applications that work with industry-standard data like HL7v2, FHIR and DICOM; our Life Sciences API is accelerating genomics research; our Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program helps organizations achieve secure interoperability among healthcare data sources; and Cloud Data Loss Prevention provides a fully managed service designed to help discover, classify, and protect sensitive data. We’re pleased to add the Healthcare Consent Management API to our portfolio of solutions, and to support healthcare and life sciences professionals as healthcare data begins to span a variety of devices, scenarios, and locations.

Helping small business customers think big with help from cloud technology,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/keap-migrates-to-google-cloud-for-scale-security-and-uptime/,"Editor’s note: Keap selected Google Cloud initially to overcome scalability issues related to on-premises data centers. Here, we’ll look at how moving to the cloud helped Keap overcome those challenges with a whole range of Google products to bring always-on, mission-critical services to its users—and free up the time and resources to develop and push their services further. Keap provides the technology and services that help small businesses accelerate growth with an all-in-one customer relationship management (CRM), sales, and marketing automation solution. With more than 200,000 users, we also provide the support, coaching, and access to partners that our customers need to help make entrepreneurship a reality. We’ve migrated our infrastructure to Google Cloud, and also take advantage of the broader Google ecosystem to serve our customers and help them grow. With Google Cloud, we’ve saved time, effort, and cost to scale compute resources, so we can now stay ahead of customer demand and use our valuable DevOps time to modernize our apps and technologies. We’ve added redundancy, security, and the best options to work with our open source products.Turning to cloud to simplify and scaleRecently, we needed to address infrastructure challenges with our multiple on-premises data centers and disparate technologies, which had become painful and costly to manage. We'd hit a difficult point in scaling our infrastructure—it was taking us a long time to spin up servers. It was resource-intensive, and we had redundancy and disaster recovery challenges. Scaling resources to keep up with our growing customer demand was taking too much time, effort, and cost. However, our engineering teams wanted to focus those resources instead on DevOps to modernize Keap’s own applications and technologies. Also looking to improve security and redundancy in our architecture, our leadership team was weighing the business potential of emerging cloud products. We decided that moving to the cloud would help us overcome the challenges of our on-premises infrastructure while reaping powerful new benefits for the overall business.We considered AWS, where we already had a few components, Azure, and Google Cloud as providers. Ultimately we chose to migrate everything over to Google Cloud for its cost-effective pricing, impressive security capabilities, and flexible tools that would work with our open source products. Google Cloud stood out with its partnership approach to our digital transformation—our employees wanted to work with the Google Cloud team because they were so passionate about helping us meet our specific needs, and they’ve lived up to that promise.With Google Cloud, there are so many different offerings they bring to the table that they go beyond the typical vendor relationship. It’s a true partnership.Migrating, modernizing, and streamlining with cloudWhen we evaluated public cloud providers for migrating all workloads from data centers to the public cloud, Google Cloud stood out for going above and beyond other providers in helping us identify our path to successful migration. Overall, our teams found the cloud transition remarkably smooth—it took about three months—and immediately we began to reap significant business benefits. Our uptime has improved, we’ve added capacity to our customer solution more efficiently, and it’s given us confidence in our scalability. Not to mention it brought an overall cost advantage, and far better peace of mind than our old hosting approach. Adopting Google Cloud has already helped us modernize in a few key areas:Infrastructure. We used a lift-and-shift approach to replicate our on-premises workloads, data stores, and infrastructure in Google Cloud. We chose Google Compute Engine to give our users a faster, more efficient way to spin up virtual machines on-demand and Google App Engine to develop and host web applications in data centers managed by Google Cloud. Our engineers really enjoyed developing solutions on App Engine. When we first got started, we took advantage of Google Cloud’s support of common tooling and open source capabilities that allowed our teams to use their existing skills with no need to learn a completely new tech stack. This approach helped us eliminate the need for disparate technologies and streamline their management. Now we could easily scale our infrastructure to support business applications or meet spikes in traffic or demand, without wondering if we had staff on hand with the right skills, training, or qualifications. We could offload all this to Google Cloud, helping us minimize the day-to-day management burden—and the overall risk to the business. Moving to the cloud improved our uptime and helped us efficiently add capacity. We also benefited from cost savings over our on-premises model, and moving to the cloud has given us more confidence in the long-term scalability and dependability of our operations.Data analytics and visualization. Before Google Cloud, our internal team of business analysts relied upon a largely manual approach to analytics and reports, pulling data from various sources and cobbling them together. This time-consuming and inefficient process didn’t bring the real-time insights we needed to quickly react and drive the business forward. We chose to modernize our data stack in order to give our analysts valuable time back while also increasing employee access to trusted, actionable insights—which we knew would help create increased efficiency and opportunity throughout the business. We chose BigQuery, Google Cloud’s serverless, multicloud data warehouse, to store and analyze data. Our team also selected Looker’s modern business intelligence and data application platform to provide self-service access to consistent metrics and actionable insights. While we initially planned to build a platform in-house, we’ve discovered we can leverage the power of Looker while still maintaining the control and customization we need. Looker has contributed to the growth of our data culture here at Keap by helping to deliver the right data to the right people at the right time—in a way that works best for their workflow. For example, our management team especially loves the ability to access Looker directly from their mobile devices so they can make data-informed decisions from anywhere. In addition to the majority of Keap employees now leveraging Looker on a daily basis, we've also used Looker to provide our customers with powerful reporting and visibility into their organizations.Now, our data analysts can devote their time to more strategic analysis instead of constantly running reports. We can ask more complex questions that give us deeper insight into our business and a greater understanding of our customers. Our data team has now transformed from a cost center to a team focused on revenue-generating opportunities, for example, providing embedded analytics to customers as a valuable opportunity to increase overall satisfaction and create upsell.API management. Keap also uses Google’s Apigee API Management Platform to improve the way our teams design, secure, and manage our APIs—and to create new experiences our customers love. We get about 18 billion API calls from partners every year. Before Apigee, we had disparate policies for each API, and a legacy API management platform that couldn’t keep up with the traffic. But we were able to transition our API traffic to Apigee with no disruptions in performance. Apigee streamlined and standardized development processes and enabled our developers to apply global security policies and other controls to all of our APIs. With Apigee’s hosted environment, our developers had a more efficient way to build apps and services and then create and manage APIs for them. We’re now also better able to monitor, throttle, and analyze partners’ use of our APIs. Our partners have noticed the improved speed and performance that has been enabled by Apigee—our APIs perform two to three times faster now. With Apigee, we're currently exploring new ways to monetize our API traffic as an entirely new revenue stream for us. Potential strategies include charging for the API, using APIs to drive traffic to our marketplace, and upselling premium subscription packages. Exploring a world of products for a better customer experienceOnce the migration was complete, we discovered additional ways we could use Google products—beyond Google Cloud—to improve our business processes and help our employees become more efficient and effective. With Google, we have the ability to run sophisticated marketing campaigns using the entire Google ecosystem, including YouTube, Google Analytics, the Google Display Network, Discovery Ads, and even the Gmail messaging app. We’ve integrated first-party data into Google Analytics 360 to gain a more complete picture about traffic conversion.We also use Google Workspace within our own CRM product. For example, many of our small business customers already use Google Calendar or Gmail and wanted to keep those solutions. This integration makes Keap’s CRM solution much more effective since our customers can send emails and schedule follow-up appointments on their Google Calendar directly within the Keap CRM. Charting the road aheadWe’re currently planning a major move of all our services to Google Kubernetes Engine to take advantage of its open source container orchestration platform and improve the way users deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. We’re confident that the use of containers and microservices will provide much more visibility into specific products, services, and applications, which will be critical in minimizing potential degradation or disruption of service. We like the opportunities we see ahead with Google Cloud, which offers so many different options. We love having so many solutions available to us through one vendor. Partnering with Google Cloud has given us more than the typical vendor relationship, and we look forward to working with them to identify even more opportunities to grow our business.Read more about Keap and their CRM solution.

Conversational AI with Apigee API Management for enhancing customer experiences,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/conversational-ai-with-dialogflow-and-apigee-api-management/,"The pandemic has accelerated enterprises’ digital transformation investments, notably their efforts to use AI and the cloud to meet rising customer expectations. This means, among other things, that virtual agents and other interactive bots should be part of an organization’s customer service toolset.To provide the excellent experiences that customers demand, it’s not an option for enterprises to continue to rely on live agents, which are hard to scale, or outdated contact management systems with rigidly scripted flows, which are as likely to frustrate customers as to answer their questions. In fact, Gartner predicts in its February 2020 article “Top CX Trends for CIOs to Watch” that by 2022, 70% of customer interactions will involve emerging technologies such as machine learning (ML) applications, chatbots and mobile messaging, up from 15% in 2018. However, integrating virtual agents or bots with enterprise systems and processes can be difficult. Chat and voice bots or virtual agents rely on enterprise data, systems, and business functions, accessed via APIs and integration frameworks. To successfully facilitate this process, Google Cloud offers several solutions--such as Contact Center AI, Dialogflow and Apigee API management--that are helping enterprises to launch powerful virtual agents without being bogged down by system complexity. The Woolworths Approach: Providing cutting-edge customer experiences with Apigee and Dialogflow Woolworths, one of the largest retailers in Australia, demonstrates the power of conversational AI and API management, as it has leveraged these technologies to provide seamless customer experiences across a wide range of channels, from web and mobile apps to Google Home. These experiences include the virtual agent Olive, which was created by WooliesX (the company’s digital business unit) and uses both Dialogflow and Apigee to deliver services.Apigee helps the company manage APIs across its business, which speeds up development of new digital experiences by giving Woolworths developers secure, simple, and consistent access to the data and functionality they need. Olive uses Dialogflow as its natural language platform, with APIs providing the information Olive needs to serve up useful customer interactions. The result is that customers have a consistent experience across numerous Woolworths brands, such as Dan Murphy’s and BIG W--all accessible from a variety of digital platforms and assistants. In a Google Cloud Next presentation, Joshua Rogers, Platform Technology Manager at Woolies X, said this consistency and flexibility around customer preference “generate a bond with our customer” that serves long-term retention.“We want customers to connect with Woolworths and our business units in a way that’s comfortable for them,” said Nick Eshkenazi, Chief Digital Technology Officer at Woolworths. “It could be through social media, or any smart home devices. So, we leveraged Google Cloud’s Dialogflow and Apigee API management solutions to build a new virtual agent called Olive. We’ve seen market-leading performance from Olive right from the start.”Click to enlargeTaking a closer look at how Woolworth built Olive, the chatbot sits atop digital applications and microservices, hosted within Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), that call on other services and sources of data to complete the customer’s request. An API Gateway provided by Apigee, which also played a key role in the company’s cloud migration, facilitates this process. Data is then funneled back into applications in GKE, which prepares it for delivery to the customer, whether via Google Hangouts, a first-party text-based chatbot, Google Home devices, or a Hub’s IVR. Apigee API Management and Dialogflow: How do they work togetherClick to enlargeThrough APIs, virtual agents created with Dialogflow communicate with both customers and backend systems that contain the information or experiences that customers need. This process requires fast response time: roundtrip delay should be less than 150 milliseconds (ITU-T G.114 recommends a maximum of a 150 ms one-way latency). With multiple disparate backend systems and legacy applications involved, getting a response within this acceptable time window can be very challenging. Apigee provides this glue using its pre-warm cache capability to get a nearly instantaneous response.Additionally, those call requests may require access to systems localized in multiple clouds and/or on-premises systems. Apigee fulfillment simplifies, orchestrates, and secures the interaction between those APIs and an enterprise’s business processes. And because Apigee acts as an abstraction layer, it makes it possible to monitor APIs, SLAs (service-level agreements), and SLOs (service-level objectives)—all capabilities that help organizations such as Woolworths to ensure they’re delivering fast, useful, seamless experiences to customers.  For many enterprises, connectivity between conversational AI solutions and backend systems is challenging and time consuming. However, with Dialogflow and Apigee, those challenges can be quickly surmounted, leaving enterprises enough time to focus on delivering delightful experiences to their end-consumers. Try Dialogflow and Apigee for free and start unlocking new digital experiences for your customers.Related ArticleThe time for digital excellence is here—Introducing Apigee XApigee X, the new version of Google Cloud’s API management platform, helps enterprises accelerate from digital transformation to digital ...Read Article","Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:00:00 -0000"
The time for digital excellence is here—Introducing Apigee X,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/apigee-x-google-clouds-more-powerful-api-management-platform/,"Digital transformation has been a top enterprise priority for years, and in the wake of the global pandemic, that urgency has only increased. Many industries have had to manage in weeks or months what previously would have taken years. According to surveys conducted for our “State of the API Economy 2021” report, three-quarters of enterprises remained focused on digital transformation in 2020, and two-thirds of those companies actually increased their investments. APIs are the backbone of digital transformation, and to help organizations navigate today’s challenging landscape, we’re announcing Apigee X. A major release of our API management platform, Apigee X seamlessly weaves together Google Cloud’s expertise in AI, security and networking to help enterprises efficiently manage the assets on which digital transformation initiatives are built. “APIs have become one of the most crucial steps for enterprises to achieve digitalization. APIs are key to adopting modern architecture patterns such as microservices, EDA, serverless or hybrid/multicloud,” wrote research & advisory firm Gartner in its July 2020 report “Gartner Market Share Analysis: Full Life Cycle API Management, Worldwide, 2019.” “As enterprises reopen post-COVID-19, they will have to find their own path to the new normal. The most successful will have started rescaling and reinventing themselves during the crisis, but the bulk of them will start at reopening. Rescaling and reinventing goes through a decomposition and a recomposition of their operating practices, and the role of an API platform in those activities is paramount. The more effective and extensive the API platform is, the quicker and easier rescaling and reinventing will be.”  Because APIs are how software talks to software and how developers leverage data and functionality at scale, APIs are not just a component in the software stack, but rather products that developers use to execute business strategies and achieve innovation at scale. Like all products, APIs need to be managed, and as Apigee turns 10 this month, we bring a decade of deep expertise and experience from working with over a thousand customers globally. “Apigee provided guidance on how we should roll out our API strategy and how we can think strategically about digital transformation using APIs,” said Rick Schnierer, Vice President, Annuity Technology, at Nationwide Insurance. “What used to take us two to three months to develop as a monolithic service now takes days as a microservice. Apigee has also allowed us to federate development, meaning our developers are empowered to create and share APIs on their own rather than going through a centralized model. We have business connections coming through the Apigee API management platform that we wouldn't have even thought to initiate on our own.”  “At Deutsche Bank we are looking forward to using Apigee X as we design and implement API solutions integrated into our ecosystem,” said Shaun Cotter, Managing Director, Corporate Bank Technology at Deutsche Bank. “The effective and secure use of API-led integration is a key component of our Google Cloud partnership, and will enable the bank to better connect services internally, innovate with third parties and offer our products to a broader client base.” Achieving digital excellence with Apigee XAs increased digital transformation investments may suggest, competitiveness is increasingly less about transformation ambitions and more about actual transformation. It’s not enough to simply use the cloud, have APIs, or even adopt API management. Rather, the requirement is digital excellence: the ability to rapidly and repeatedly deploy and scale, and to consistently deliver on digital programs. It involves adopting digital as a core enterprise strategy for building profitable API-based platforms and delivering measurable business outcomes. Helping customers make this leap--from gradual transformation and API-based programs to digital excellence and API-based platforms--has been our core goal for Apigee X. “At Pitney Bowes we are always looking for ways to provide the best experience for our clients and Apigee’s technology helps us make this possible. We are very excited about the launch of Apigee X, as it can help businesses elevate API-led programs, and accelerate digital transformation even more,” said James Fairweather, Chief Innovation Officer at Pitney Bowes. “During these uncertain times, organizations worldwide are doubling-down on their API strategies to operate anywhere, automate processes, and deliver new digital experiences quickly and securely. By powering APIs with new capabilities like reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Cloud Armor (WAF), and Cloud CDN, Apigee X makes it easy for enterprises like us to scale digital initiatives, and deliver innovative experiences to our customers, employees and partners.” What Differentiates Apigee XLet’s take a closer look at Apigee X.Global reach, high performance & reliabilityWith shifting market conditions and dynamic work environments, organizations are scaling API programs for global expansion and supporting distributed workforces. Apigee X makes it easy for customers to harness the power of Cloud CDN to maximize the availability and performance of APIs globally. Customers can now deploy their APIs across 24 Google Cloud regions and enhance caching at more than 100 locations. Multi-layer security & privacyScaling API programs also opens up more doors for fraudulent activities, both internally and outside of the organizational boundaries. As our “State of the Economy 2021” report elaborates, in the past year, Apigee saw an increase in abusive API traffic of over 170%. Apigee X offers an integrated approach for applying capabilities like Cloud Armor web application firewall for enhanced API security and Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authenticating and authorizing access to the Apigee platform. It gives businesses more control over encrypted data with CMEK while allowing them to store data in the region of their choice and control the network locations from which users can access data by using VPC Service Controls.AI-powered automationWith the increasing adoption of APIs for powering enterprise business-critical applications, there’s growing pressure on operations and security teams to ensure they’re always available, secure and performing as expected. Apigee X applies Google’s industry-leading AI and machine learning capabilities to historical API metadata to autonomously identify anomalies, predict traffic for peak seasons, and ensure APIs adhere to compliance requirements. This helps API operators and security admins focus on programs that really matter to their business, rather than spending time on trivial tasks.Being an industry leader in the space of API management, and having worked across customers for a decade, we’ve seen how enterprises can truly transform their businesses by leveraging APIs to build new digital experiences, more powerful and intelligent automations, and more impactful data-driven applications. Today’s launch continues to expand what API management can do, and it offers businesses an onramp to achieve digital excellence over the next decade. We can’t wait to see what you’ll do next with us.

How leading enterprises use API analytics to make effective decisions,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/api-monitoring-and-analytics-for-2021/,"Our “State of the API Economy 2021” report indicates that despite the many financial pressures and disruptions wrought by COVID-19, 75% of companies continued focusing on their digital transformation initiatives, and almost two-thirds of those companies actually increased their investments and efforts.Because APIs are how software talks to software and how developers leverage data and functionality in different systems, they are at the center of these digital transformation initiatives. As organizations across the world have shifted how they do business, IT organizations have scrambled to meet demands for new applications—and to do more with APIs.  API analytics usage is seeing an explosive growthLeading businesses use API analytics to not only inform new strategies but also align leadership goals and outcomes. Because executive sponsors tend to support initiatives that produce tangible results, teams can use API metrics to unite leaders around digital strategies and justify continued platform-level funding for the API program. This demand is responsible for surging API analytics usage. Among Apigee customers, API analytics adoption increased by 75% from 2019 to 2020—growth that reflects organizations’ broader need to holistically assess the business and digital transformation impacts of API programs.API analytics point to opportunities To remain competitive in today’s hyper-connected world, one key question needs to be answered: “How do we drive impact with our digital initiatives while also making sure we're putting our limited resources to the best use?“ API analytics support API providers in this endeavor by helping them to determine which digital assets are key drivers of business value and to create a strategic view of digital interactions. By tracking which APIs are being consumed by certain communities of developers, which APIs are powering the most popular apps, and how performant APIs are, organizations can understand which digital assets need optimization or iteration, which digital assets are being leveraged for new uses or by new communities, which digital assets are driving revenue, and more. Beyond helping enterprises answer questions they’ve already identified, API analytics also surface patterns that may be unexpected—and that help both IT and business leaders refine the KPIs they use analytics to generate. If an API becomes popular with developers in a new vertical for example, that may persuade the enterprise to focus on KPIs like adoption among these specific developers, rather than on overall adoption.  Best Practices for defining effective API metricsWhen our survey respondents were asked how API usage at their company is currently measured, top responses included metrics focused on API performance (35%), on traditional IT-centric numbers (22%), and on consumption of APIs (21%). But when asked about preference for API measurement, business impact topped the list (43%). The data suggests that API effectiveness metrics vary across geography and industry, with measurement by business impact or API performance serving as a collective north star.Establishing a framework to connect digital investments directly to metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) is among the most important areas of strategic alignment for ensuring a successful API strategy. Successful programs clearly define and measure a combination of business metrics, such as direct or indirect revenue, and API consumption metrics, such as API traffic, the number of apps built atop given APIs, and the number of active developers leveraging APIs. Good KPIs are a cornerstone of an effective API analytics effort, but they can be difficult to define. Here are some effective KPIs to help position an API program for success.Operational KPIsAverage and max call latency: P1 latency, or elapsed time, is an important metric that impacts customer experiences. Breaking down this KPI into detailed metrics (e.g., networking times, server process and upload and download speeds) can help provide additional insights for measuring the performance of APIs--and thus of the apps that rely on them.Total pass and error rates: Measuring success rates in terms of the number of API calls that trigger non-200 status codes can help organizations to track how buggy or error-prone an API is. In order to track total pass and error rates, it’s important to understand what type of errors are surfacing during API usage.API SLA: While one of the most basic metrics, API Service Level Agreements (SLA) is the gold standard for measuring the availability of a service. Many enterprise SLAs leave software providers little-to-no room for error. Providing this level of service means a provider’s upstream APIs need to be running--and that requires API monitoring and analytics to maintain performance and quickly troubleshoot any problems.  Adoption KPIsDevelopers: This target is commonly intended to improve API adoption. Enterprises should consider using this metric in combination with other metrics that confirm a given API’s business utility.Onboarding: The portal that application developers use to access APIs should ideally feature an automated approval process, including self-service onboarding capabilities that let users register their apps, obtain keys, access dashboards, discover APIs, and so on. The ease and speed with which developers can navigate this process can significantly impact the adoption of an enterprise’s API program. Just as consumers are unlikely to adopt a service if too much friction is involved, developers are less likely to adopt APIs that cannot be easily and securely accessed. API traffic: This target can help API programs develop a strong DevOps culture by continuously monitoring, improving, and driving value through APIs. Enterprises should consider coupling this target with related metrics up and down the value chain, including reliability and scalability of back-ends.API product adoption: Retention and churn can identify key patterns in API adoption. A product with high retention is closer to finding its market fit than a product with a churn issue, for example. Unlike subscription retention, product retention tracks the actual usage of a product such as an API. Business Impact KPIsDirect and indirect revenue: These targets track the different ways APIs contribute to revenue. Some APIs provide access to particularly rare and valuable datasets or particularly useful and hard-to-replicate functionality—and in these cases, enterprises sometimes directly monetize APIs, offering them to partners and external developers as paid services/products. Often, however, an API can generate more value if enterprises focus on adoption rather than upfront revenue. A retailer won’t make much money charging partners for access to a store locator API, for example, but if they make the API freely available, partners are more likely to use it to add functionality to their apps and the retailer is more likely to benefit because its business is exposed to more people through more digital experiences. It is important to be able to track both direct revenue from monetized APIs and forms of indirect value, such as how adoption of an API among certain developers supports those developers’ revenue-generating apps. Likewise, it is important to be able to adjust pricing models to find the right blend; analytics can reveal, for example, whether an API is most valuable if offered for free, if offered for a flat subscription rate, or if offered in a “freemium” model with free base access and paid tiers. Partners: This target can be used to accelerate partner outreach, drive adoption, and demonstrate success to existing business units.Cost: Enterprises can reduce costs by reusing APIs rather than initiating new custom integration efforts for each new project. When internal developers use standardized APIs to connect to existing data and services, the APIs become digital assets that can be leveraged again and again for new use cases, typically with little if any overhead costs. By tracking API usage, enterprises can identify instances in which expense that otherwise would have gone to new integration projects has been eliminated thanks to reusable APIs. Likewise, because APIs automate and accelerate many processes, enterprises can identify how specific APIs contribute to faster development cycles and faster completion of business processes--and how many resources are saved in the process.  API analytics is at the core of successful API programsComprehensive monitoring and robust analytics efforts for API programs are among the most important ways to make data-driven business decisions. For an enterprise unsure how to scale its API program or uncertain about which next steps to take, analytics may literally be the difference-maker, providing insights that illuminate previously hidden opportunities, remove ambiguity, drive consensus, and help the business grow.Citrix is among the Google Cloud customers using Apigee’s monitoring and analytics solutions to proactively monitor the performance, availability, and security health of their APIs. “Apigee has a lot of built-in analytics that run automatically on every API, and Citrix can track any custom metric it wants. We’re gaining real-time visibility into our APIs, and that is helping us grow a strong API program for both internal and external developers.” says Adam Brancato, senior manager of customer apps at Citrix. When monitoring and analytics tools are integrated directly, rather than bolted on, the platform managing APIs is the same platform capturing data—which means the data can be acted on more easily and in near-real time. A full lifecycle API management solution such as Apigee provides near real-time monitoring and analytics insights that enable API teams to measure the health, usage, and adoption of their API, while also offering the ability to diagnose and resolve problems faster. The solution also enables teams to keep abreast of all essential aspects of their API-powered digital business.Want to learn more? The “State of API Economy 2021*” report describes how digital transformation initiatives evolved throughout 2020, as well as where they’re headed in the years to come. Read the full report*This report is based on Google Cloud’s Apigee API Management Platform usage data, Apigee customer case studies, and analysis of several third-party surveys conducted with technology leaders from enterprises with 1,500 or more employees, across the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.Related ArticleTop 5 trends for API-powered digital transformation in 2021Google Cloud’s State of APIs report investigates digital transformation in 2020 and where trends point in 2021 and beyond.Read Article","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 17:00:00 -0000"
Top 5 trends for API-powered digital transformation in 2021,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/top-5-trends-for-api-powered-digital-transformation-in-2021/,"Our “State of the API Economy 2021” report confirms that though digital transformation has been among enterprises’ top business imperatives for years, the COVID-19 pandemic and changing market conditions have increased this urgency. Organizations across the world weathered the pandemic by compressing years of digital transformation into just a few months. Our research reflects this urgency: in response to the pandemic and its rippling effect on business in 2020, nearly three in four organizations continued their digital transformation investments. Two-thirds of those companies are increasing investments or completely evolving their strategies to become digital-first companies.Digital  transformation relies on an organization’s ability to package its services, competencies, and assets into modular pieces of software that can be repeatedly leveraged. Every company in the world already has valuable data and functionality housed within its systems. Capitalizing on this value, however, means liberating it from silos and making it interoperable and reusable in different contexts—including by combining it with valuable assets from partners and other third parties.APIs enable these synergies by letting developers easily access and combine digital assets in different systems, even if those systems were never intended to interoperate. In their most basic form, APIs are how software talks to software, but if the APIs are designed with the developer experience in mind, rather than just as bespoke integration projects, they become extremely powerful, enabling developers to repeatedly leverage data and functionality for new apps and automations.As part of creating the “State of API Economy 2021” research report, we surveyed over 700 IT executives around the globe to identify key trends about how they are responding to the pandemic and its rippling effects on business. Our findings identified five key trends in 2021 for API-first digital transformation:1. Increasing SaaS and Hybrid Cloud-based API DeploymentsWhen asked about future areas of technology focus and investment, one in two respondents reported increasing SaaS use to administer workloads, as well as an increase in hybrid cloud adoption —both areas in which APIs are crucial tools. APIs serve a variety of use cases from connecting internal applications to enabling digital ecosystem strategies, so it’s no surprise that many organizations are choosing to leverage a mix of on-premises and cloud infrastructure to host those APIs.2. Analytics Expand Competitive AdvantageWhile deploying APIs helps companies develop their digital presence, measuring API performance is key to optimizing their use and illuminating further routes to innovation. When our survey respondents were asked how APIs at the company are currently measured, top responses included metrics focused on API performance, those focused on traditional IT-centric numbers, and those focused on consumption of APIs. But when asked about preference for API measurement, business impact—including Net Promoter Score (NPS) and speed-to-market—tops the list.Leading businesses use API analytics to not only inform new strategies but also align leadership goals and outcomes. Because executive sponsors tend to support tangible results (like an API that’s attracting substantial developer attention or accelerating delivery of new products), teams can use API metrics to effectively unite leaders around digital strategies and justify continued platform-level funding for the API program. 3. AI and ML - Powered API Management is Gaining TractionWhile some aspects of API security and management are as straightforward as applying authentication mechanisms to control access or applying rate limits when API calls exceed a certain limit (such as during a DDoS attack), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are emerging as important ways for organizations to bolster their API management and security capabilities.It’s no wonder that new, AI- and ML-powered API security and monitoring solutions are gaining widespread adoption to help companies detect and block malicious attacks. In fact, usage for anomaly detection, bot protection, and security analytics grew 230% year-over-year among Apigee customers between September 2019 and September 2020.4. API Ecosystems Are Innovation DriversAPIs are the backbone of digital business ecosystems that encompass networks of partners, developers, and customers. These ecosystems may be composed entirely of internal parties (i.e., developers within an organization) or may include external individuals and organizations, such as suppliers, third-party providers, contractors, customers, developers, regulators, or even competitors.Our research found that while companies of all API maturity levels are likely to be focused on speeding up development of new applications and connecting internal applications, high-maturity organizations are significantly more likely to focus on developing a developer ecosystem or B2B partner ecosystem around their APIs.5. API Security and Governance More Important Than EverIn 2020, virtually all industries, from retail and manufacturing to finance and hospitality, shifted how they do business, with a focus on digital maturity coming into sharp relief in the wake of COVID-19. Customer, employee, and partner-facing operations all moved to digital mediums. While this created new opportunities for innovation, it also exacerbated the difficulty of keeping up with growing security threats by opening up more avenues for hackers to access sensitive data.When designed and managed properly, APIs provide business optionality to control access to digital assets, to combine old systems with new technologies, and to empower developers to experiment, innovate, and react to changing customer needs. But APIs exposed without the proper controls, security protections, developer considerations, and visibility mechanisms can become a liability that puts corporate and customer data at risk. Our research demonstrates increased investment in security and governance remain top-of-mind to enable enterprises better leverage and protect their digital assets.Even as 2021 begins with carryover from many of 2020’s challenges, looking ahead, enterprises should start thinking beyond digital transformation for the coming decade and strive to achieve digital excellence. Businesses will need to leverage advanced cloud capabilities around security, global reach, access management, and artificial intelligence to support the growing global digital ecosystems. With well-designed and managed APIs, enterprises can help ensure that they’re able to adapt their business from one disruption to the next. And, at Google, we are here to partner with you to help achieve your digital excellence.Want to learn more? The “State of API Economy 2021” report describes how digital transformation initiatives evolved throughout 2020, as well as where they’re headed in the years to come.

A year of API-driven digital transformation,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/google-cloud-apigees-2020-api-management-innovations/,"2020 was a challenging year for many organizations as they faced sudden changes in consumer behavior and market dynamics. The shift to digital channels is nothing new, and even in 2019, digital was already the preferred option for commerce and collaboration across many industries—but in the wake of the global pandemic, these channels became the first and only option for many businesses. Preference gave way to necessity almost overnight. According to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday 2020 shopping witnessed a growth of 22% and Cyber Monday saw 15.1% increase compared to 2019.  More importantly, this is going to be a long term shift. According to McKinsey, over 60% of customers changed their shopping behavior in 2020. With in-person and brick-and-mortar operations disrupted across much of the world, the past year’s trends mean that more than ever, a business’s ability to operate relied on its ability to insert itself into digital channels and to engage with customers in new ways. APIs are the foundational mechanisms powering these digital interactions, and hence API management becomes a more urgent competency for many companies as they navigate the impacts of COVID-19.  The role of API management platformsWe have seen many organizations that invested in API management benefiting in different ways during these challenging times. Here are some examples:Deliver innovation faster: Companies challenged with legacy systems were able to unlock valuable data and services via APIs, allowing developers to build new experiences faster. To learn more, check out this video, from Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir, that explains how Australian Energy is leveraging APIs to build a hub for open data.Build business ecosystems: APIs allowed organizations to collaborate and quickly integrate with partner ecosystems to transform their business models. Read this article to learn how CHAMP Cargosystems executed ecosystem strategies to help airlines navigate COVID-19 disruptions. Automate operations with AI: During periods of peak online activity, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, AI-powered features like traffic prediction, anomaly detection, and API monitoring helped organizations to focus on business-critical concerns and keep services online without interruption. See this video to understand how TMobile has leveraged APIs, and the process automations they enable, across diverse technology ecosystems ranging from mobile services to machine learning to the Internet of Things. Develop new revenue streams: Many businesses suffered declines in top-line revenue during 2020, but monetization of API products helped some to stay competitive by unlocking new sources of revenue. To learn more, view this on-demand webinar that includes how MTN Group, a leading multinational telecommunications company, is harnessing APIs to unlock new revenue opportunities. Google Cloud’s continued innovation in API Management To help organizations navigate 2020’s challenges, as well as adapt to trends in enterprise IT that have been unfolding for years ahead, Google Cloud launched several new capabilities throughout the year to bolster how we help our customers with API management:API Gateway helps developers securely share their serverless workloads and monitor consumption on serverless APIs. Apigee datasource for AppSheet helps citizen developers accelerate digital transformation, empowering them to harness APIs, and the more powerful datasets and functionality to which they provide access, for no-code app development. Apigee Adapter for Envoy As enterprises adopt microservices-based architectures, Apigee was first to build an adapter for Istio to expose services outside the mesh or between services running entirely within the mesh. Apigee adapter for Envoy now integrates Envoy-based services into your Apigee environment, extending Envoy’s capabilities to include API management and letting developers expose services behind Envoy as APIs.Thought leadership, best practices, and engagement with the API community We continued our engagement with the communities of developers, technical, and business leaders looking to do more with APIs. For example we launched That Digital Show, a podcast series in which we share field-tested best practices and real-world use cases to help enterprises to build and scale their API programs. We also offered our Business Innovation Roadshow, which explored how to think like a futurist to evaluate emerging business opportunities, how to discern key technology signals, and when and how to act in order to build an API-first strategy. We  launched a new series of ebooks, The Path of Most Resilience, that explores three tangible ways in which APIs help build business resilience via improved operational efficiency, accelerated innovation, and the development of richer customer experiences. We also published a range of blog posts and articles— if you missed any, you can catch up on all the API goodness here. Our thought leadership efforts also encompassed several industry-specific discussions, including:APIs for Healthcare The Digital Transformation of Healthcare, which examines how the healthcare industry is navigating these difficult times and how patients will soon benefit from new digital services.Getting Digital with Healthcare, which involves a panel of experts discussing three key pillars the healthcare industry is leveraging to help organizations enable data interoperability and provide value-based care.APIs for Marketing: The Automotive Industry, which surveys how APIs are being used for marketing and digital transformation in the automotive industry.APIs for Media and Entertainment, which looks at the digital future of movies, television and gaming.API-powered Open banking, which discusses how APIs can accelerate compliance, create connected customer experiences, and launch new productsLast but not the least, in partnership with Oxford Economics, we surveyed over 1,000 CIOs of large organizations (i.e., those with over $2 billion in revenue), from around the world and across industries, to understand their digital business ecosystem strategies—and the benefits they derive from cultivating those relationships. Check out the key findings of the survey and the role of APIs in building and scaling digital ecosystems.What’s next?We believe most of the current shifts in market dynamics will have long-term implications on consumer behavior and the way businesses operate; even before the pandemic disrupted enterprises throughout the world and increased the urgency around digital transformation, results from our Oxford Economics survey indicated that business leaders were connecting APIs to  the modern digital experience and efficiencies required to be competitive. Digital experiences across a range of form factors—in offices, stores, homes, or the field—will increasingly define how work gets done, how customers interact with businesses, and how businesses interact with one another. Interactions and automations among data and functionality in difference systems will power these experiences—and APIs will continue to power those interactions. Going into 2021, in order to reinvent and globally scale their efforts, enterprises will need to think beyond digital transformation, as which has become an issue of table stakes rather than the mark of a differentiated leader. Instead, businesses must strive to pursue digital excellence—and that means API management becomes even more important. It’s not enough to simply use APIs, though that is a prerequisite for success. Businesses need to harness their APIs to pursue new business models, such as monetizing data for an outside audience, or new partnerships, such as connecting one’s own APIs to those of social networks in order to create richer, wider-reaching customer experiences. Businesses need to learn from APIs, applying machine learning to discern trends in developer and end user behavior and further fortify digital services against attackers. And they need to extend their APIs in new directions, opening them not only to traditional developers but also the new breed of no-code application builders. To boost our customers’ efforts towards digital excellence, we look forward to launching several new capabilities in the coming year that will let customers leverage Google Cloud’s industry-leading offerings to accelerate their API programs. We’re excited to see what you build with them.","Fri, 08 Jan 2021 17:00:00 -0000"

How to develop secure and scalable serverless APIs,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/build-restful-apis-on-serverless-platforms-like-cloud-run/,"Among Google Cloud customers, we see a surge in interest in developing apps on so-called serverless platforms that let you develop scalable, request- or event-driven applications without having to set up your own dedicated infrastructure. A serverless architecture can considerably improve the way you build applications and services, in turn accelerating innovation and increasing agility. Serverless computing is also a key enabler of “composable enterprise” strategies where you modularly reuse and combine data and functionality to create new customer experiences and new business models.  Adding an API facade to serverless applications is a great way to connect data, integrate systems, and generally build more modern applications. APIs let a business securely share its data and services with developers both inside and outside the enterprise; doing so with serverless makes it easy to scale those APIs securely—without any of the usual technical complexity. Benefits of serverless RESTful APIsAs organizations expand their API programs, a key question is how to build comprehensive APIs that are highly scalable and secure. To accomplish this, many organizations have been migrating their business-critical APIs to serverless architectures. For these organizations, serverless APIs provide several benefits:ScalabilityReduced hardware and labor costs due to cloud-based payment modelReliability and availabilityNo need for load balancing, infrastructure maintenance, or security patchesOperational efficiency Increase in developer productivityDesigning serverless APIsDevelopers use REST APIs to build standalone applications for a mobile device or tablet, with apps running in a browser, or through any other type of app that can make a request to an HTTP endpoint. By building that API on a serverless environment like Cloud Run or Cloud Functions, you can have that code execute in response to requests or events—something you can’t do in a traditional VM or container-based environment. Since building a robust serverless application means designing with services and data in mind, it is important to develop APIs as an abstraction layer for your data and services. As an example, a database activity such as changes to a table’s row could be used as an event trigger that happens via an API call.Leveraging Google Cloud API Gateway to secure your APIsGoogle Cloud API Gateway lets you provide secure access to your backend services through a well-defined REST API, which is consistent across all of your services, regardless of the service implementation. This provides two key benefits: Scalability - API Gateway gives you all the operational benefits of serverless, such as flexible deployment and scalability, so that you can focus on building great applications. It can manage APIs for multiple backends including the serverless Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and App Engine, as well as Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine.Security  - Google Cloud’s API Gateway adds additional layers of security, such as authentication and key validation, by configuring security definitions that require all incoming calls to provide a valid API key. It also allows you to set quotas and specify usage limits to protect your APIs from abuse or excessive usage.Here is a quick demo of Google Cloud API Gateway:Get started nowWith API Gateway, you can create, secure, and monitor APIs for Google Cloud serverless back ends, including Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and App Engine.

Advancing healthcare with the Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program,https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/google-cloud-healthcare-interoperability-readiness-program/,"The 21st Century Cures Act, a United States law enacted at the end of 2016, mandates patient data interoperability for payers, providers, and healthcare organizations. As we approach rolling implementation deadlines, healthcare organizations are wrestling with how to liberate data from siloed systems—not only to give patients more granular control of their data, but also to improve outcomes by giving doctors a more complete view into their patients’ conditions.The stakes are significant. Yet, in speaking with our customers, the number of healthcare organizations that feel prepared to meet these new requirements is small. Why is this the case? In short, providers and payers aren’t sure where to start. And with many critical applications running on legacy IT systems that aren’t built on modern web standards, the goal can seem daunting.That’s why today, we’re launching the Google Cloud Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program. The program is designed to help healthcare organizations:Understand their current interoperability maturity levels;Map out a stepwise journey to enable interoperability; and Navigate changes and increase their readiness for the new Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules.With COVID-19 underscoring the importance of even more data sharing and flexibility, the next few years promise to accelerate data interoperability and the adoption of open standards even further—ideally ushering in new and meaningful partnerships across the care continuum, new avenues for business growth, and new pathways for patient-centered innovation.  Our program is built to meet customers wherever they are on their interoperability journeys, and to empower them with tailored services, technologies and strategies. We’re working with a variety of both consultants and ISV partners like Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, HCL Technologies, KPMG, MavenWave, Pluto7, SADA and 8K Miles Healthcare Triangle to meet our customers’ unique needs and support the changes needed to meet the upcoming regulatory requirements.   How is interoperability achieved?Just as interoperability is foundational to achieving the transformational goals in healthcare for everything from telemedicine to app-based healthcare ecosystems, application programming interfaces, or APIs, are the foundation for interoperability. APIs have been around for decades and allow data to flow across disparate systems. Whereas older APIs were designed for bespoke integration projects, modern APIs are designed to be easy for developers and have become the standard for building mobile applications.API management tools can put a security gateway between patient data and developers or apps, helping to protect a patient’s control over access to and uses of their data. And with API management, healthcare organizations can pursue the same sort of innovative models around healthcare data, while also applying governance and security controls, streamlining infrastructure complexities, and maintaining regulatory compliance and patient privacy. In addition to APIs, implementation of  open data standards—such as FHIR—is another critical step toward interoperability. We’ve worked closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and collaborated across the tech industry to support open standards to electronically exchange healthcare information and build an ecosystem that supports data privacy, security, compliance, and API management.How can the Google Cloud Interoperability Readiness Program help? Google Cloud has long supported data interoperability and an API-based ecosystem to reduce friction surrounding healthcare data. Through our Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program, we’ll help customers understand the current status of their data and where it resides, map out a path to standardization and integration, and make use of data in a secure, reliable, and compliant manner. This program provides a comprehensive set of services for interoperability, including: HealthAPIx Accelerator provides the jumpstart for the interoperability implementation efforts. With best practices, pre-built templates and lessons learned from our customer and partner implementations, it offers a blueprint for healthcare stakeholders and app developers to build FHIR API-based digital experiences.Apigee API Management provides the underpinning and enables a security and governance layer to deliver, manage, secure and scale APIs; consume and publish FHIR-ready APIs for partners and developers; build robust API analytics, and accelerate rollout of digital solutions.Google Cloud Healthcare API enables secure methods (including de-identification) for ingesting, transforming, harmonizing, and storing your data in the latest FHIR formats, as well as HL7v2 and DICOM, and serves as a secondary longitudinal data store to streamline data sharing, application development, and analytics with BigQuery. Interoperability toolkit that includes solution architectures, implementation guides, sandboxes and other resources to help accelerate interoperability adoption and streamline compliance with standards such as FHIR R4. As we reflect on the lessons of COVID-19, building resilient interoperable health infrastructure will not only be a catalyst, but table stakes for delivering better care. The Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program aims to help free up patient data and make it more accessible across the continuum of care, as well as set up organizations for long-term success with more modern, API-first architectures.

How APIs expand reach and drive ROI for content producers,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/how-apis-help-the-media-and-entertainment-industry/,"Over the course of just a few years, the ways in which we consume content have changed dramatically. In order to compete in this new landscape and to adapt to the technological change that underpins it, media studios and other content producers should consider providing relatively open access to their proprietary content. This necessitates a cultural change across the industry. Cable television cancellation, or “cord cutting,” has increased significantly since 2010, and with the pandemic accelerating the trend, there are now more than 30 million cord-cutter U.S. households. The American digital content subscriber now watches streaming content across an average of more than three paid services. For several years, more video content has been uploaded to streaming services every 30 days than the major U.S. television networks have created in 30 years. With an abundance of content readily available across a growing number of platforms, each accessible from a plethora of different devices, media providers should invest in making it easier for consumers to find the video content they want to watch. If a viewer can’t access and stream something with minimal effort, they’ll likely move on to one of the countless alternatives readily at their disposal. Think about voice-based assistants and search services. When prompted to find a piece of content, these services sift through a multitude of third-party libraries, where access is permitted, and remove friction from the user experience. It’s important for media companies to evolve from siloed, closed-off content libraries to participation in digital ecosystems, where a host of partnership opportunities can precipitate wider reach and revenue opportunities. Ultimately, joining these communities facilitates the delivery of the right experience on the right device at the right time to the right consumer.Navigating a streaming jungle Legacy silos prevalent in the media and entertainment industry must be broken down to make way for richer viewing experiences. It’s critical that studios roll out content faster, distribute it more securely, and better understand their audiences so they can provide customers the content they want in the contexts they want. In order to achieve these goals, publishers must leverage technology that’s purpose-built for the demands of a more dynamic, competitive landscape.Publishers should consider embracing application programming interfaces, or APIs, to better connect with viewers and maximize return on content production. APIs, which facilitate interoperability between applications, allow publishers’ content to be consumed by more developers and publishing partners, who subsequently create more intelligent, connected experiences surrounding that content for the viewers.  This new content value chain should leverage an API management tool that resides on top of cloud infrastructure to manage the partnerships that ultimately ensure media can easily make its way to the consumer on their ideal viewing platform. APIs let content owners and distributors interact with partner technologies to drive value from social interactions and attract a wider audience via insights derived from data and analytics. Perhaps most important is the ability for APIs to allow content to follow users as they start watching on one device, stop, and transfer to another. Content is increasingly separated from the device. APIs enable experiential continuity to be maintained when devices are changed, facilitating more seamless experiences across devices of different form factors and screen sizes. Consumers expect content to follow them wherever they go. How APIs improve content creation and distribution Last year, streaming services produced more original content than the entire television industry did in 2005—so for many media producers, adjusting to consumers’ new media consumption habits involves not only making content available on more devices but also producing more content, faster. Studios should explore solutions that help them collaborate globally and produce great content more securely and efficiently. In the content value chain, APIs are used to seamlessly connect artists and production crews to necessary resources and assets across multiple production technologies and locations. For example, via APIs, a film crew in one country can record, encode, and collaborate and share content with another studio in another country. These cloud-based production environments can offer a single destination for all contributors to access the assets they need while also keeping those assets accessible only to the right people in the right contexts. In addition, creating and distributing content requires a complex supply chain. APIs let multiple parties, each responsible for a different core function (such as content purchasing, storage, payments, physical media delivery, customer service, etc.), meld into a seamless experience for the customer.  Rather than reimagining their strategy when it comes to these backend tasks, studios can leverage third-party APIs to expedite getting content in front of the right people and ultimately execute each of those functions more efficiently than they could on their own. Besides tapping into partner APIs, savvy media and entertainment companies can accelerate consumption of content by developing their own public APIs to securely provide access to their asset libraries, pricing, and other relevant information. This is important, as it lets media creators use the same API to serve content to a variety of services and device types, thus helping them scale content distribution without simultaneously having to scale security resources. Media companies’ APIs can also be implemented  to deliver better customer experiences. Because APIs are involved each time a customer streams a video and every time a developer integrates a media asset into a new app or digital experience, API usage analytics can provide powerful insights into where, when, by whom, and on what devices different types of media—from traditional movies to augmented reality and other interactive content—are being accessed. Bringing it all together with an API management tool In order for studios to quickly adapt to a content value chain and distribute their content across multiple platforms, it’s important that they implement an API management tool on top of the cloud environment that powers content creation and distribution. For instance, Google Cloud offers Apigee, which sits on top of its public cloud. This added layer facilitates the integration between a studio’s proprietary environment and the strategic partnerships that APIs make possible. The API lifecycle can be rather complex, especially when multiple APIs are leveraged. It can include:Planning, design, implementation, testing, publication, operation, consumption, maintenance, versioning, and retirement of APIsLaunch of a developer portal to target, market to, and govern communities of developers who leverage APIsRuntime managementEstimation of APIs’ valueAnalytics to understand patterns of API usageUsing a management layer such as Apigee increases the likelihood that media and entertainment companies can combine the ability offered by public clouds and APIs to adapt to the requirements of new devices and protocols. It brings next-generation technology together to ensure studios can scale, secure, monitor, and analyze digital content creation and distribution.Related ArticleHelping media companies navigate the new streaming normalAs media and entertainment companies evolve their future plans as a result of COVID-19, they should keep new audience behaviors top of mi...Read Article","Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:00:00 -0000"
