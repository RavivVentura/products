stripe,,,,,,,https://twitter.com/stripe/status/1321141034949238785,@FeldAryeh Thanks for clarifying! You'll want to save the PaymentIntent ID to your own database and associate it with the order (you can also add metadata to the PaymentIntent). You can then listen for the payment_intent.succeeded event. You may find this helpful: https://t.co/Pxa2qHvghS,https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/integration-builder,,event

It's the cardholder's right to issue a chargeback, even in the case of donations. 3D Secure is an effective means of preventing fraudulent chargebacks, but you'd need to speak with ko-fi to find out if it can be enabled on their platform.",,,event
